  Yamaha brought the XSR900 to market in 2016, releasing it in two variants worldwide.
  The first, a variant utilizes a yellow and black paint scheme with gold inverted fork. This paint
  scheme is a 60th Anniversary Edition first utilized on other Yamaha models in 2015, such as the YZF-R1,
  to commemorate Yamaha's 60 years of racing heritage which began in 1955.[6][7] and strongly resembles the
  classic "speed block"[8] design popularized by Kenny Roberts in the 1970s.[9] The second variant utilizes
  a more muted aluminum tank over black frame and black inverted fork.[10] (See Photo)

  The engine has a power output of 115 hp (86 kW) @ 10,000 rpm and 65 lb⋅ft (88 N⋅m) @ 8,500 rpm.
